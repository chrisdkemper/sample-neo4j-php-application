#Beginning Neo4j - Sample application

This is the sample application that goes along with Chapter 8 of Beginning Neo4j. This PHP application allows readers (or anybody else, for that matter) to download the code, and (thanks to Vagrant) get it up and running very easily.

This application will grow and become better over time, either through my own development, or community involvement, but hopefully, both.

For now, the location has been set to London but this will be changed soon enough. As mentioned in the book, any big changes will be tracked using the references, and any new ones added will be listed here.
